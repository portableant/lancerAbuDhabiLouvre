# Metadata 

A lancer from the archer’s frieze, from Darius’s palace at Susa. This frieze panel is made from glazed siliceous bricks and dates to the Achaemenid Empire circa 510 BC.

Achéménide Reigne - Lancier, détail de la frise des archers du palais de Darius à Suse.

# Paradata

This model was shot using a Sony A6000 in artificial light during a tour of the new Louvre Abu Dhabi in general opening hours. 44 images were shot as jpegs and RAW. This model was created just from unedited jpegs (as I am lazy.) Masking needs tightening.
